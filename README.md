My portfolio website that contains many of my projects that I have worked on. This includes personal projects and freelance projects.

I use a variety of different technologies and resources to create this site and the many projects contained inside it. The main tools are HTML, CSS, and JS. However I will use the tools, technologies, and frameworks that I feel I will be able to create the best work with.

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor my code as I learn different techniques and methods in order to make sure all my projects are as readible and efficient as possible.

## Lessons Learned:

There are a vast variety of different resources with many different pros and cons that come with each. In order to create the best projects I can, I must continue to push myself to continue to learn how to use these resources so that they become tools I will be able to rely on in the future. Always keep learning!
